The report sees dark clouds ahead but also silver linings.\\n\\nDark clouds:The report, which is based on interviews with officials in government, energy, and technology, makes four projections for AI\\u2019s energy consumption. In the base scenario, future growth and efficiency gains are similar to those of the past five years. The agency also plots a \\u201ctake-off\\u201d scenario in which AI adoption happens faster, a \\u201chigh efficiency\\u201d scenario with lower energy needs, and a \\u201cheadwinds\\u201d scenario in which adoption of AI slows or infrastructure bottlenecks impede construction. Among the conclusions:\\n\\nSilver linings:AI already makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient. The authors expect these savings to accelerate.\\n\\nYes, but:The authors concede that lower energy costs for AI likely will lead to much greater consumption \\u2014 according to theJevons paradox\\u2014 so more-efficient models and hardware will result in higher energy consumption overall.\\n\\nBehind the news:Data centers were growing rapidly prior to the boom in generative AI. Data centers\\u2019 electricity use doubled between 2000 and 2005 and again between 2017 and 2022, driven by the growth of cloud computing and data storage, streaming and social media, and cryptocurrency mining. However, these periods of accelerating growth were followed by periods of slower growth as efforts to cut costs led to more-efficient software and hardware. The authors expect this pattern to hold.\\n\\nWhy it matters:The IEA report is a first-of-its-kind analysis of AI\\u2019s energy requirements, how they\\u2019re likely to grow, as well as the potential of the technology itself to reduce those requirements. It confirms that AI is poised to consume huge amounts of energy. However, it also suggests that today\\u2019s energy costs will be tomorrow\\u2019s energy savings as AI makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient across a wide variety of industries.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re thinking:While demand for electricity for data centers is growing rapidly,\\u00a0calibrating the right level of investment is tricky. High levels of growth come\\u00a0with high levels of hype that can lead analysts to overestimate future demand.

The report sees dark clouds ahead but also silver linings.\\n\\nDark clouds:The report, which is based on interviews with officials in government, energy, and technology, makes four projections for AI\\u2019s energy consumption. In the base scenario, future growth and efficiency gains are similar to those of the past five years. The agency also plots a \\u201ctake-off\\u201d scenario in which AI adoption happens faster, a \\u201chigh efficiency\\u201d scenario with lower energy needs, and a \\u201cheadwinds\\u201d scenario in which adoption of AI slows or infrastructure bottlenecks impede construction. Among the conclusions:\\n\\nSilver linings:AI already makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient. The authors expect these savings to accelerate.\\n\\nYes, but:The authors concede that lower energy costs for AI likely will lead to much greater consumption \\u2014 according to theJevons paradox\\u2014 so more-efficient models and hardware will result in higher energy consumption overall.\\n\\nBehind the news:Data centers were growing rapidly prior to the boom in generative AI. Data centers\\u2019 electricity use doubled between 2000 and 2005 and again between 2017 and 2022, driven by the growth of cloud computing and data storage, streaming and social media, and cryptocurrency mining. However, these periods of accelerating growth were followed by periods of slower growth as efforts to cut costs led to more-efficient software and hardware. The authors expect this pattern to hold.\\n\\nWhy it matters:The IEA report is a first-of-its-kind analysis of AI\\u2019s energy requirements, how they\\u2019re likely to grow, as well as the potential of the technology itself to reduce those requirements. It confirms that AI is poised to consume huge amounts of energy. However, it also suggests that today\\u2019s energy costs will be tomorrow\\u2019s energy savings as AI makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient across a wide variety of industries.\\n\\nWe\\u2019re thinking:While demand for electricity for data centers is growing rapidly,\\u00a0calibrating the right level of investment is tricky. High levels of growth come\\u00a0with high levels of hype that can lead analysts to overestimate future demand. For example, Microsoft, after examining\\u00a0its forecasts,canceleddata-center projects that would have consumed 2 gigawatts.\"}",
