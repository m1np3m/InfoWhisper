In today\\u2019s edition of Data Points, you\\u2019ll learn more about:\\n\\nMeta Poaches Top Talent\\u00a0to Build\\u00a0Superintelligence Labs\\n\\nMeta reorganized its AI teams into Meta Superintelligence Labs, bringing in 11 senior hires from OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google under the direction of Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman. The unit merges groups previously in charge of research, large language models, and products. Zuckerberg has pledged to invest \\u201chundreds of billions\\u201d of dollars in next-generation models, and the new lab marks\\u00a0an aggressive push to build systems that match or surpass human performance and intensifying\\u00a0AI\\u2019s talent and spending race. (Bloomberg)\\n\\nGoogle launches open-source Gemini CLI\\n\\nGemini CLI is a command line interface that executes natural language commands using the company\\u2019s Gemini Pro 2.5 model. The CLI offers a free tier with 60 requests per minute and 1,000 requests per day, and it supports the MCP standard to connect\\u00a0to external data and services. It directly challenges OpenAI\\u2019s Codex and Anthropic\\u2019s Claude Code by offering free access to similar command line capabilities, potentially accelerating AI adoption among developers who\\u00a0avoid paid tools. (VentureBeat)\\n\\nBaidu open-sources Ernie chatbot\\n\\nSearch giant Baidu announced it will open-source its Ernie chatbot, marking a shift from its previous closed approach and challenging closed competitors. The decision follows an aggressive pricing strategy that has included making Ernie free in February and slashing API prices by 80 percent in March, as the company seeks to undercut rivals and build a developer ecosystem around its technology. Industry analysts describe the latest move\\u00a0as a \\\"declaration of war on pricing.\\\" (Silicon Angle)\\n\\nCloudflare blocks AI crawlers by default and tests pay-per-crawl\\n\\nIn a decisive move against companies that crawl the web to collect AI training data, Cloudflare turned on its AI-bot blocker by default for all customers and launched a Pay Per Crawl beta that lets web publishers charge scrapers. The service enables publishers to block identified AI crawlers altogether or selectively and to allow crawlers that don\\u2019t collect\\u00a0training data, such as search engine crawlers. The change potentially raises the cost of large-scale web scraping and may encourage model developers to pay licensing fees for data instead of gathering it freely. (Wired)\\n\\nChinese venture capital firm launches dynamic AI benchmark\\n\\nHongShan Capital Group released Xbench, a free benchmark designed to test\\u00a0models on both academic knowledge and business task execution, including activities like sourcing job candidates and matching advertisers with influencers. HongShan intends to update the benchmark quarterly with new questions and maintains a half-public, half-private dataset to prevent models from memorizing desired responses. Currently, ChatGPT o3 ranks first across categories followed by ByteDance\\u00a0Doubao and Google Gemini 2.5 Pro. The regularly updated benchmark could reduce the risk of systems overfitting to fixed tests. (MIT Technology Review)\\n\\nAI-generated rock band covertly gains 500,000 Spotify listeners\\n\\nA fake band called Velvet Sundown drew more than 500,000 Spotify listeners within weeks of releasing two rock-style albums. Online sleuths found no record of the four listed band members, spotted image and lyric artifacts typical of generation models, and noted that Spotify and some other services do not require AI-generated music to be disclosed. The case illustrates that generated music can reach a mass audience, and it may increase pressure on businesses and regulators to support watermarking and transparency. (Ars Technica)\\n\\nWant to know more about what matters in AI right now?\\n\\nReadthe latest issueofThe Batchfor in-depth analysis of news and research.\\n\\nLast week, Andrew Ng shared a strategy for building with AI: Reduce project scope to fit your available time. He shows how even small builds can accelerate learning and unlock user feedback.\\n\\n\\u201cIf you have only an hour, find a small component of an idea that you\\u2019re excited about that you can build in an hour.
