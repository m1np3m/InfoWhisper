Theyarguedthat overlapping regulations and a still-unfinished \\u201ccode of practice\\u201d create legal uncertainty that could slow AI deployment and weaken Europe\\u2019s competitiveness. A delay would allow regulators to finalize technical standards and give developers time to adapt their systems, reducing compliance risk for companies that build or integrate large language models in the EU. (The Wall Street JournalandFinancial Times)\\n\\nTNG releases weights for DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera, a merging of DeepSeek models that cuts inference cost\\n\\nTNG Technology Consulting, a German firm, built DeepSeek-TNG-R1T2-Chimera by merging DeepSeek-R1-0528, DeepSeek-R1, and DeepSeek-V3-0324. The 671 billion-parameter reasoning LLM achieves about 90 percent of Deepseek-R1-0528\\u2019s benchmark performance while trimming output lengths by 60 percent. The team\\u2019sassembly-of-expertsmodel-merging method cut response time and GPU cost roughly in half. The release offers a compute-efficient, cost-effective alternative to Deepseek-R1-0528. You can download the weightshereunder an MIT license. (VentureBeatandHugging Face)\\n\\nTencent releases weights for Hunyuan-A13B with switchable reasoning\\n\\nHunyuan-A13B is an 80 billion-parameter mixture-of-experts large language model that activates groups of 13 billion weights at run time and lets users toggle reasoning on or off. It can process inputs of up to 256,000 input tokens and delivers performance that approaches that of larger models on the AIME math exam, GPQA graduate-level science test, and several agent benchmarks. You candownloadthe weights under a license that limits commercial uses to 100 million monthly active users. (The DecoderandHugging Face)\\n\\nAlibaba launches closed-weights Qwen VLo for image editing and generation\\n\\nThe tech conglomerate opened a preview of Qwen VLo, a large vision-language model that interprets images, generates new ones, and alters existing ones. Unlike earlier models in the Qwen family, Alibaba did not release weights. Qwen VLo builds on the Qwen-VL line of vision-language models with a progressive left-to-right image generator, natural-language image editing, and support for various image resolutions. The model can swap image backgrounds, transfer image styles, and edit image objects. You cantryit via a web interface. (Tech in AsiaandGitHub)\\n\\nHugging Face offers Reachy Mini robot kits\\n\\nHugging Face is accepting orders for Reachy Mini, an open desktop robot kit that users can assemble and program in Python. Reachy robots feature code and some hardware schematics that are freely available for users to use and modify. The Lite version costs $299, while the Wireless version costs $449 and includes a Raspberry Pi 5, Wi-Fi, battery power, camera, microphones, and access to models. Shipments of Lite units start in late summer, with Wireless units following in fall. (Hugging FaceandTechCrunch)\\n\\nMicrosoft links AI to $500 million in cost savings amid ongoing layoffs\\n\\nIn-house AI tools trimmed Microsoft\\u2019s call-center costs by more than $500 million last year, the company told staff. Chief Commercial Officer Judson Althoff said Copilot now writes 35 percent of the code for new products, handles interactions with some small customers, and boosts revenue per salesperson by 9 percent. The internal briefing followed layoffs that have eliminated about 15,000 jobs this year, most recently sales and other customer-facing roles.
